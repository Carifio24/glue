Standalone MacOS X and Windows applications
===========================================

**Platforms:** MacOS X and Windows

On MacOS X and Windows, the easiest way to install glue along with a few of
the common glue plugins is to download pre-built single-file applications.

.. note:: This installation method is very recent, so if you run into any issues
          it would be really helpful if you could let us know by `opening an issue
          <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-standalone-apps/issues/new>`_. In the
          mean time, you can always try one of the other installation methods.

MacOS X
-------

Donwload the `glue 2021.10.2.dmg
<http://glueviz.s3.amazonaws.com/installers/2021.10.2/glue%202021.10.2.dmg>`_
file, open it and copy the **glue 2021.10.2.app** application to your
**Applications** folder (or any other location you want to use).

Open the copied application - after a short wait, you will likely see a dialog that looks like:

.. image:: images/warning1_osx.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

Click **OK** then go to the MacOS X **Settings**, then **Security and Privacy**, then go to the
**General** tab. You will likely see the following message:

.. image:: images/warning2_osx.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

Click on **Open anyway**, then in the following dialog:

.. image:: images/warning3_osx.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

Click **Open**. The glue application should now open! You should only need to do all this when
installing a new version, if you relaunch the same application it should now work straight away.

Windows
-------

Donwload the `glue 2021.10.2.exe
<http://glueviz.s3.amazonaws.com/installers/2021.10.2/glue%202021.10.2.exe>`_ file.
Once the file has downloaded, open the **glue 2021.10.2.exe** application. You
will likely then see a dialog such as:

.. image:: images/warning1_windows.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

Click on **More info** and you will then see:

.. image:: images/warning2_windows.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

Click on **Run anyway** and glue should now open.
